1. Let's consider a datacenter for organization X that spans about 5,000 square feet. 
Based on the average power density of datacenters in 2010 (see Figure 19), and assuming the entire area is populated with IT equipment, 
what's the approximate power consumption of the entire datacenter?
__2.5 MW__

_Correct! The average watts per square foot in 2010 was approximately 500 W. The total power consumption of the datacenter is 500 Ã— 5,000 = 2,500,000 W = 2.5 MW._

2. Which of the following techniques is not effective in improving the power efficiency of datacenters?
__Retro encabulator__

_Correct! The retro encabulator is a fictional machine._
